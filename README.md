Star Correction Script for Monochromatic Astro-Images
This script improves monochromatic astrophotography images by correcting overexposed star pixels that exceed a given brightness threshold.
By setting a threshold value, pixels beyond that limit are replaced (or normalized), helping to reduce saturation and artifacts often caused by long exposures.

Import this script into Siril (v1.4 or later) and run it as part of your image processing workflow.
